INSTALLATION GUIDE
__________________

Requirements
------------

* Linux kernel >2.4 (2.6 recommended) with appropriate netfilter modules
* Iptables >1.3 with iptables-save and iptables-restore binaries
* Sudo >1.6 privileges escalation tool
* PHP5 >5.1 without safe-mode and with sessions support
* Smarty >2.6 PHP templates processing framework
* Web server with PHP5 support (Apache2 recommended)
* Web browser with JavaScript enabled (Firefox3 recommended)

Configuration
-------------

This application is web-based. You need to identify the web user on your system
to grant proper permissions. Web user may change according to your Linux
distribution and web server: www-data, apache, www, etc.

* Extract archive to web directory
	* tar -xzf nspm-xxx.tar.gz

* Grant permissions to web user
	* chown -R www-data.www-data

* Edit sudo configuration
	* visudo or edit /etc/sudoers
	* Grant root privileges to web user for Iptables binaries execution

	root		ALL = (ALL) ALL
	www-data	ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables*

* Edit application configuration file
	* edit inc/config.inc.php
	* Define display preferences and system paths to binaries

* Customize application security (optionnal but recommended)
	* Define administrator login and password
		* Default credentials are set to login "admin" and password "!nspm!"
		* Password is encrypted using SHA1 hash algorithm
		* To compute SHA1 password, use command "echo -n 'password' | sha1sum"
	* Choose authentication method
		* "session" enables NSPM web-based authentication
		* "http" sends HTTP authentication headers to browser
		* If Apache authentication is already used, http will not be triggered
	* Restrict access to configuration file
		* chmod 640 inc/config.inc.php

* Secure your global installation (optionnal but recommended)
	* Bind web server to local addresses only
	* Create appropriate firewall rules to restrict connections

/!\ Caution /!\
---------------

Backup your current Iptables configuration before running the application. Even
though most common rules and options are supported and will be automatically
imported, some specific parameters may be lost in the process. Note that no
modification will be made before you actually save a new configuration, so pay
close attention to first run.
