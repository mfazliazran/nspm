Configuration
-------------

This application is web-based. You need to identify the web user on your system
to grant proper permissions. Web user may change according to your Linux
distribution and web server: www-data, apache, www, etc.

* Extract archive to web directory
	* tar -xzf archive.tar.gz

* Grant permissions to web user
	* chown -R www-data.www-data

* Edit sudo configuration
	* visudo or edit /etc/sudoers
	* Grant root privileges to web user for Iptables binaries execution

	root		ALL = (ALL) ALL
	www-data	ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/iptables*

* Edit application configuration file
	* edit inc/config.inc.php
	* Define display preferences and system paths to binaries

* Secure your web directory!
	* Bind web server to local addresses only
	* Create appropriate firewall rules to restrict connections
	* Enable server-embedded user authentication (.htaccess)

/!\ Caution /!\
---------------

Backup your current Iptables configuration before running the application. Even
though most common rules and options are supported and will be automatically
imported, some specific parameters may be lost in the process. Note that no
modification will be made before you actually commit a new configuration so pay
close attention to first run.
